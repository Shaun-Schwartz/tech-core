Given the task of creating a Meetup Clone ('TechCore') exclusively for Tech Companies, this project is designed to allow users to create organizations and show their upcoming events and news. With an initial timeline of two days the focus is to implement critical features before those less important.

The App allows companies to advertise their upcoming events and news to users.

Project TechCore allows companies to create an organization page, which they can use to advertise events and related news. Visitors to the site will see a list of companies filterable by search as well as an events calendar and news page. Admins moderate organizations and users through an admin panel.
